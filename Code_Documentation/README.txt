This source code documentation was created with Doxygen 1.6.1 in combination with Graphviz (Inheritance, Caller and Collaboration diagrams) and the HTML Help Workshop (creating chm files).

I've chosen the chm format, because it's pretty compact (and practical to use). Yet I'm not sure about viewers for this format under linux and the HTML Help Workshop won't run there for sure. Anyway, it is very easy to create plain HTML or outputs as Latex or RTF (for example).

Using Doxygen for source code documentation is just a proposal. Doygen is mostly compatible to PHPDoc, yet more powerful than phpDocumentor - in my opionion. The problem is: all classes, function etc. would have to be documented (well, except those from third party classes that - maybe - are already documented on their own; which ever Senayan is using currently). Most (php) editors have options to easily add DocBlocks, so the main matter is that you still have to know what a class or function does to add a description. ;) 

Well, just an idea, but without documentation it will become ever harder for others to contribute to the project - as well as developers might scratch their head looking at their own code's mysteryies a year later (or is it just me? :)).
