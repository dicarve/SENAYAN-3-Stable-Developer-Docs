This entity relationship diagram is bases on Senayan3 Stable-12 (reverse engineered from that version). I think I didn't miss any relationships, but no guarantee at all... ;)

The ERD was created with MySQL Workbench 5.1.18 You can get it for free at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/5.1.html (available for all major OS).
